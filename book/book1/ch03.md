# Chapter 3: Data Analyses

Okay. We can read. We can write.

What's next?

We can 'rithmetic.

Let's do it. Why? Reading and writing data is all very well and good, but data
is data. Data, itself, doesn't tell you anything: the analyses do.

This chapter will get you to a point where your analyses on your data will give
you that clarity so that you know what to do.

Let's work on [a whole new data set](/src/book/book1/heroes-serendale.csv).

```HASKELL
data Realm = CV | SD
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

data Hero =
   Hero { cost           :: Double,
          realm          :: Realm,
          idx, rarity    :: Integer,
          class1, class2 :: String,
          level, gen     :: Integer,
          trade          :: String,
          classScore     :: Double,
          growthScore    :: Double }
      deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```

With these data structures and the skills you learned from [the previous 
chapter](ch02.md), parse in the above set.

Let's take this step-by-step, shall we?

The first thing we notice, obviously, is that the `Hero`-type is a much more
complex type than the `Coin`-type from [the previous chapter](ch02.md). This
means that the method of parsing in this data-structure is a much more intricate
affair.
