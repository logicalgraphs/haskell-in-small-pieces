# Chapter 3: Data Analyses

Okay. We can read. We can write.

What's next?

We can 'rithmetic.

Let's do it. Why? Reading and writing data is all very well and good, but data
is data. Data, itself, doesn't tell you anything: the analyses do.

This chapter will get you to a point where your analyses on your data will give
you that clarity so that you know what to do.

Let's work on [a whole new data set](/src/book/book1/heroes-serendale.csv).

```HASKELL
data Realm = CV | SD
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

data Hero =
   Hero { cost           :: Double,
          realm          :: Realm,
          idx, rarity    :: Integer,
          class1, class2 :: String,
          level, gen     :: Integer,
          trade          :: String,
          classScore     :: Double,
          growthScore    :: Double }
      deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```

With these data structures and the skills you learned from [the previous 
chapter](ch02.md), parse in the above set.

### Quiz 4

Write a program that parses the daters above into the `Hero`-type (above).

[src](/src/book/book1/dfk-csv-parser.hs) *... but write it yourself; don't peek*

When you complete the quiz, you can do the following.

```HASKELL
>>> heroes <- heroM "heroes-serendale.csv"
>>> let (hs, errs) = heroes
>>> (length hs, length errs)
(3675,0)
```
