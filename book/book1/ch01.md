# Book 1

Haskell.
In.
Small.
Pieces.

Because: why not?

## Chapter 1: Reading input; writing output. 


```Haskell
main :: IO ()
main = getLine >>= 
       putStrLn . ("Hello, " ++)
```

[src](/src/book/book1/ex1a-io-monad.hs)

### So, yeah, okay, whatever, but how do I compile this thing?

```bash
$ cd src/book/book1/
$ ghc ex1a-io-monad.hs -o yo
```

... *it compiles, assembles, links, then loads.*

... *Yes: I'm that old.*

```bash
$ echo geophf | ./yo
Hello, geophf! I love you forever and want to give you muchas smooches!
```

Huh. Where'd that come from?

Anyway! Easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy!

## Quiz 1:

Rewrite ex1a-(etc).hs to output the muchas smooches result.

[src](/src/book/book1/quizzy1-muchas-smooches.hs) ... don't look until you've 
completed the quiz, iff'n you'll get spankies from Madonna. That's a real thing,
btw.

## Explanation.

No.

You can DYOR. You know: look up things like `(>>=)` and `(++)` and stuff. If
you can't, consider taking up birdwatching or gardening.

But here's the meta.

... *geophf goes full meta*

A programmer once told me his wife said, after he solved a particularly thorny
problem:

"So, you changed a string into another string, right?"

And that, folks, is what programming is, that's what math is, that's what
everything all boils down to: you transform a set of input symbols to a set
of output symbols.

## Summary

So: chapter 1, book 1 just gave you everything. If you can take an input string
and change it to an output string, then you've written a program.

You can now do anything.

So: now. Go do anything.

That's the rest of this book.
